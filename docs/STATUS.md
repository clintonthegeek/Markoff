**Last updated:** 2026-08-13 (canvas production arc — Phase 1 CLOSED, P1.5)

## Workfront — canvas production arc (D5 part 1)

User-opened 2026-08-13, same day the spike closed PASS. Goal: take
`libs/markoff-canvas` to feature parity (Corbomite contract v2, old-leaf
parity, Obsidian Live Preview benchmark, collab rendering surface).

- **Spec (normative):**
  [`specs/2026-08-13-canvas-production-design.md`](specs/2026-08-13-canvas-production-design.md)
- **Plan (do the topmost unchecked task):**
  [`plans/2026-08-13-canvas-production-plan.md`](plans/2026-08-13-canvas-production-plan.md)
  — phases P1–P7, user gates G1 (a11y scope), G2 (Corbomite adoption),
  G3 (retirement decision). Phase 1 (core promotions) closed 2026-08-13
  at P1.5; Phase 2 (projection map) is next.

Standstill after this opening (spec §7): canvas active; `markoff-core`
open **only** for plan-named seams; live/styled bug-fix-only until G3;
source untouched. Queue **#18** is absorbed into the plan
(P1.1 done, P2.1–P2.3 next).

## Test baseline

**288/288 (100%)** on the full `scripts/run-tests.sh` (277 standstill
+ 11 canvas), re-verified 2026-08-13 at Phase 1 close (P1.5) — count
unchanged from spike close: P1.1–P1.4 grew existing executables rather
than adding new ones. The plan ratchets this up per task; any drop is
a regression (classify before fixing).

## Dormant items

- Queue **#13** — source cursor/selection translation rewrite.
- Styled tables — in-grid cell edit, row/col ops (moot if G3 retires
  styled; frozen until then).
- Release scaffolding — install/export rules + header tiering for a
  non-submodule consumer.
- E-arc — dormant since 2026-05-25 (`docs/e-arc/`, closed board).
- Discipline-Log open smells — `docs/queue.md`.

## Corbomite pin

Corbomite tracks Markoff at `libs/markoff-family`. As of 2026-08-12
(Corbomite `fde31e82`) pinned at Markoff `b349f122`. Re-pin guidance:
jump to current master when next touched; **never** pin into
`8c13c5d..079ac1f` (list-after-table SIGSEGV window, fixed `b1b238f`).

## History

Arc dispositions, closed queues, and dated banners:
[`STATUS-LOG.md`](STATUS-LOG.md), `docs/archive/` (incl. the
2026-08-13 pre-canvas snapshots of CLAUDE.md and queue.md; spike
verdict: `specs/2026-08-13-markoff-canvas-spike-design.md` §10).
