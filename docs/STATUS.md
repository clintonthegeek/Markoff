# Markoff — live status

Updated 2026-10-17. One screen. Task detail lives on the
[CollabText task board](plans/2026-10-12-collabtext-adoption-execution.md).
The previous board text is
[`archive/collabtext-adoption/2026-10-16-status-board.md`](archive/collabtext-adoption/2026-10-16-status-board.md).

## Now

CollabText vNext adoption is closed. There is no open adoption task. The
readiness signal is
[`docs/handoff/2026-10-17-to-corbomite-ready-for-collabtext-transition.md`](handoff/2026-10-17-to-corbomite-ready-for-collabtext-transition.md).
Corbomite may begin its transition. The implementation brief is
[`docs/handoff/2026-10-17-collabtext-transition-package.md`](handoff/2026-10-17-collabtext-transition-package.md)
and describes sources at `281e3bc1`.

Host storage, the document lease in Corbomite, application wiring, and
production network acceptance stay in the host. Physical collection stays
disabled. A14's probe budget misses stay recorded and are not waived.

## Pin

`collabtext-markoff-core-2026-10-13-alpha5` at
`e8a8e7d1a95dd50e23f38d6727921b47b814e44b` (0.2.0-alpha.5, manifest v17).
Root CMake requires that installed package. The prefix used for the
acceptance runs is `build-collabtext-alpha5/install`. Recreate a missing
prefix from the candidate's `docs/USING_VNEXT.md`.

## Latest verification

2026-10-17, A16: documentation only. The signal above is the delivery.
The suite was not re-run.

2026-10-17, A15: offscreen `scripts/run-tests.sh -E 'tst_realistic|tst_benchmark'`
on `build-dev` passed 94/94 in 28.09 s, including
`markoff_provider_interface_conformance`. Package `0.2.0-alpha.5`,
manifest v17, prefix `build-collabtext-alpha5/install`. A14's Debug,
Release, ASan/UBSan 93/93 and installed-consumer 2/2 runs stand. The
probe budget misses stand with them.

## Leaves

- `markoff-canvas` — primary editor. No open adoption task.
- `markoff-core` — provider-backed `MarkoffDocument`. No open adoption task.
- `markoff-parser` — load-time and per-block parsing.
- `markoff-source` — permanent, bug-fix only outside this migration.
- `markoff-styled` — bug-fix only; backs Corbomite reading mode.
- `markoff-live` — removed in A13. Tag `archive/markoff-live-final` keeps the
  last supported snapshot.

## Not this workfront

Closed arcs and their plans: canvas production (2026-08-15), G1 accessibility
(2026-09-30), Hologram first-heading hide (`9b0138f8`). The manual Orca pass
stays deferred until the user asks for it. Older dormant canvas notes are in
the archived status board and in [`queue.md`](queue.md). `queue.md` is not
the active task list.

## When you stop

Update the task row, the "Now" section above, and the verification line if
you ran tests. Commit that doc update with the code. Session routine:
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).
