# Live Render Restoration — Status Board

**This is the live status of the live-render restoration arc. Update after every commit, every dogfood pass, every spec amendment, every plan written.**

**Last updated:** 2026-05-02 (planning complete; awaiting first execution session)
**Working tree:** `.worktrees/foundation-exploration/`
**Branch:** `exploration/new-foundation`
**Branch tip when this entry was written:** `a9f6d0d` (R1 plans committed)

---

## TL;DR — what to do *right now*

> **Brainstorming, design, and R1 planning are complete.** The next session should pick one of the three R1 sub-plans and execute it task-by-task with TDD discipline. Any of `R1A`, `R1B`, `R1C` is a valid starting point — they're independent.
>
> **Recommended first execution:** `R1A` (`docs/plans/2026-05-02-live-render-r1a-parse-edit-sequence.md`). It's the most structurally-touchy — a signal-chain plumbing across `markoff-foundation`'s parse pipeline — and benefits from being landed first while context is fresh on it. R1B and R1C can land in either order after.
>
> **Read first** (in this order):
> 1. `docs/handoff/2026-05-02-restoration-session-brief.md` — the orientation / working-protocol doc (~250 lines; one-time read per agent context).
> 2. The plan you're about to execute (R1A / R1B / R1C). The plan is the source of truth for tasks; this status doc is the source of truth for what's been done.

## Phase board

Status legend: `pending` (not started) · `in-progress` (commits landing) · `dogfood` (implementation done; user is testing) · `complete` (acceptance criteria met).

| Phase | Plan | Status | Commits | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **R1A** | [r1a-parse-edit-sequence](plans/2026-05-02-live-render-r1a-parse-edit-sequence.md) | `pending` | — | Foundation surface: `parseUpdated` 4th arg. |
| **R1B** | [r1b-inline-span-bake](plans/2026-05-02-live-render-r1b-inline-span-bake.md) | `pending` | — | Parser surface: `TopLevelBlock::inlineSpans`. |
| **R1C** | [r1c-library-scaffold](plans/2026-05-02-live-render-r1c-library-scaffold.md) | `pending` | — | New library shell: `libs/markoff-live-render`. |
| **R2** | *not yet written* | `pending` | — | Read-only render with diff. Plan written after R1 phase acceptance. |
| **R3** | *not yet written* | `pending` | — | Cursor (Shape 1) + selection. Plan written after R2 acceptance. |
| **R4** | *not yet written* | `pending` | — | Paragraph editing through sequence-tagged binding. |
| **R5** | *not yet written* | `pending` | — | Structural keys + IME + undo coalescing. |
| **R6** | *not yet written* | `pending` | — | Other text blocks + speculation refresh. |
| **R7** | *not yet written* | `pending` | — | Lists + blockquotes (II.a, II.b). |
| **R8** | *not yet written* | `pending` | — | Math block + BlockInternalEdit (I.a, L8). |
| **R9** | *not yet written* | `pending` | — | Per-block context menu (III.c). |
| **R10** | *not yet written* | `pending` | — | Hardening + perf-budget enforcement + retire old live mode. |

**Phase acceptance gating.** A phase is `complete` only when:
1. All sub-plan tests pass (per the plan's "Acceptance criterion" section).
2. The fast-tier suite (`ctest -E "tst_realistic|tst_benchmark|tst_view_qml_live_view_qml"`) is green.
3. The user has run the phase's dogfood script (per spec §10.3) and signed off — recorded in the **Dogfood log** below with their words.

R1 has no formal dogfood script (it's foundation + scaffold; nothing user-visible yet). R1 acceptance is just "the three sub-plans' tests are all green."

## Recent-changes log

Append-only chronological record. Each entry: date, commit short SHA, one-sentence summary. **Never edit prior entries** — corrections are new entries that supersede.

| Date | Commit | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-02 | `bd10576` | docs: code-only architectural audit of live render |
| 2026-05-02 | `f6b7427` | docs(spec): live render restoration design (C-architecture, 9 layers, 10 phases) |
| 2026-05-02 | `136d600` | docs(spec): d-evolution proposal for collabtext review |
| 2026-05-02 | `a9f6d0d` | docs(plan): R1 implementation plans (R1A foundation, R1B parser, R1C scaffold) |

## Dogfood log

The user does manual dogfood testing between phases. Their feedback lives here verbatim. **Treat this section as the highest-priority signal of restoration health** — test passes don't substitute for dogfood feedback.

*No dogfood feedback yet — restoration has not begun execution.*

Format for entries:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — [phase being tested]

User script: [what was tested, per spec §10.3]
User result: [their words, copy-pasted]
Action: [what we did about it — opened a bug, amended the spec, deferred, etc.]
```

---

## Spec-amendment log

The restoration spec (`docs/specs/2026-05-02-live-render-restoration-design.md`) and D-proposal (`docs/specs/2026-05-02-d-evolution-proposal.md`) are *premise* documents — agents do not unilaterally rewrite them. When implementation surfaces something the spec didn't anticipate or got wrong, the agent **proposes** an amendment here, then waits for user approval before editing the spec. Approved amendments edit the spec inline; the amendment record stays here for the audit trail.

Format:

```
### A1 — YYYY-MM-DD — [short title]

Proposed by: [agent context / human]
Affects: [§ of spec]
Reason: [what surfaced; why the spec needs adjusting]
Proposed change: [concrete edit in spec terms]
User decision: [approved / declined / revised, with date and concrete next action]
Spec edit commit: [SHA when applied]
```

*No amendments yet.*

**The bar for amendment:** the spec is wrong about something material, OR a premise turned out to be unworkable, OR a phase boundary needs reshaping based on what the prior phase taught us. The bar is **not** "I have a different opinion" — agents implement the design as specified unless something genuinely contradicts.

---

## Plan-generation log

When a phase's predecessor lands successfully, the agent invokes `superpowers:writing-plans` to derive the next phase's plan from the spec. Each generated plan is recorded here.

Format:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — RX — [plan filename]

Generated from: spec §11 RX
Generated by: [agent context — fresh session, prior session, etc.]
Predecessor acceptance: [SHA / date of the prior phase reaching `complete`]
Self-review notes: [anything surprising the writing-plans pass surfaced]
```

*No phase-N+1 plans generated yet — R1 plans were generated as part of the spec-authoring session.*

## How to update this document

You are an agent landing in this worktree. After every commit, add an entry to the **Recent-changes log**. After every dogfood pass, add an entry to the **Dogfood log**. After every plan generation, add an entry to the **Plan-generation log**. After every spec amendment, add an entry to the **Spec-amendment log**. After every phase status transition, update the **Phase board**.

The TL;DR at the top — the "what to do right now" pointer — is the single most important field. Update it whenever the right next action changes. A fresh agent should be able to read just the TL;DR and know what to do.

**Commit changes to this file alongside the code commit they describe** — never as a standalone "status update" commit. Status updates without code changes drift; status updates bundled with their code commit stay honest.

**If you are about to start a non-trivial action and the status doc disagrees with reality** — for example, the `Phase board` says R1A is `pending` but you can see the commits are landed — fix the board first. The doc is the contract between sessions; reality must match.

1. **Audit** — `docs/2026-05-02-live-view-architectural-audit.md` *(diagnostic; what was wrong)*
2. **Restoration spec (C)** — `docs/specs/2026-05-02-live-render-restoration-design.md` *(architecture; ten phases)*
3. **D-evolution proposal** — `docs/specs/2026-05-02-d-evolution-proposal.md` *(long-term; not active work)*
4. **Session brief** — `docs/handoff/2026-05-02-restoration-session-brief.md` *(working protocol for fresh agents)*
5. **R1 plans** — `docs/plans/2026-05-02-live-render-r1{a,b,c}-*.md` *(actionable; one of these is the fresh agent's starting point)*

Plus the worktree-level `CLAUDE.md` which auto-loads and points at this status doc.
